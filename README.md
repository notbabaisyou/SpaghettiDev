# Spaghetti

Yet _another_ fork of the X.Org Display Server.

## Why?

![https://xkcd.com/927/](.repo/images/standards.png)

*replace standards with display servers

## Goals

- Maintain ABI compatibility
- Provide continued support for users either stuck with closed source drivers or legacy pre-OpenGL 3.3 hardware.
- Provide a stopgap until either Wayland finally reaches feature parity or a superior display server comes to fruition.
- Introduce additional features and fixes.
- Security hardening of the server.
- Introduction of Meatball, an implementation of Wayland on X11 based upon 12to11.
- Introduction of Fission, an improved version of modesetting designed for the Atomic Kernel Modesetting future.
