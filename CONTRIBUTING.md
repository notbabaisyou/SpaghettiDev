# Contribution Guidelines

1. AI generated contributions are not welcome.

> However, security fixes via fuzzing are allowed under the strict condition that a reproduction of
the issue is shown and the write up is authored by a human.

2. Commit messages should be concise and get to the point.

3. Changes should be per area/per file, an exception is made
for very large changesets, where squashing everything into a single commit is allowed.

4. Bug fixes affecting a stable release and master should be submitted as different PRs, per branch.
